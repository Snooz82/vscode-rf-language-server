The supported browsers are listed in the table below. The browser names are case-insensitive and some browsers have multiple supported names.\n\n```\nBrowser  Name(s)\nFirefox  firefox, ff\nGoogle Chrome  googlechrome, chrome, gc\nHeadless Firefox  headlessfirefox\nHeadless Chrome  headlesschrome\nInternet Explorer  internetexplorer, ie\nEdge  edge\nSafari  safari\nOpera  opera\nAndroid  android\nIphone  iphone\nPhantomJS  phantomjs\nHTMLUnit  htmlunit\nHTMLUnit with Javascript  htmlunitwithjs\n```\n\nTo be able to actually use one of these browsers, you need to have a matching Selenium browser driver available. See the [project documentation](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary#browser-drivers) for more details. Headless Firefox and Headless Chrome are new additions in SeleniumLibrary 3.1.0 and require Selenium 3.8.0 or newer.\n\nAfter opening the browser, it is possible to use optional `url` to navigate the browser to the desired address.\n\nOptional `alias` is an alias given for this browser instance and it can be used for switching between browsers. When same `alias` is given with two [Open Browser](#Open%20Browser) keywords, the first keyword will open a new browser, but the second one will switch to the already opened browser and will not open a new browser. The `alias` definition overrules `browser` definition. When same `alias` is used but a different `browser` is defined, then switch to a browser with same alias is done and new browser is not opened. An alternative approach for switching is using an index returned by this keyword. These indices start from 1, are incremented when new browsers are opened, and reset back to 1 when [Close All Browsers](#Close%20All%20Browsers) is called. See [Switch Browser](#Switch%20Browser) for more information and examples.\n\nOptional `remote_url` is the URL for a [Selenium Grid](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2).\n\nOptional `desired_capabilities` can be used to configure, for example, logging preferences for a browser or a browser and operating system when using [Sauce Labs](http://saucelabs.com). Desired capabilities can be given either as a Python dictionary or as a string in the format `key1:value1,key2:value2`. [Selenium documentation](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/DesiredCapabilities) lists possible capabilities that can be enabled.\n\nOptional `ff_profile_dir` is the path to the Firefox profile directory if you wish to overwrite the default profile Selenium uses. Notice that prior to SeleniumLibrary 3.0, the library contained its own profile that was used by default. The `ff_profile_dir` can also be an instance of the [selenium.webdriver.FirefoxProfile](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_firefox/selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_profile.html) . As a third option, it is possible to use FirefoxProfile methods and attributes to define the profile using methods and attributes in the same way as with `options` argument. Example: It is possible to use FirefoxProfile set\\_preference to define different profile settings. See `options` argument documentation in below how to handle backslash escaping.\n\nOptional `options` argument allows defining browser specific Selenium options. Example for Chrome, the `options` argument allows defining the following [methods and attributes](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_chrome/selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.html#selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.Options) and for Firefox these [methods and attributes](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_firefox/selenium.webdriver.firefox.options.html?highlight=firefox#selenium.webdriver.firefox.options.Options) are available. Please note that not all browsers, supported by the SeleniumLibrary, have Selenium options available. Therefore please consult the Selenium documentation which browsers do support the Selenium options. If `browser` argument is android then [Chrome options](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_chrome/selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.html#selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.Options) is used. Selenium options are also supported, when `remote_url` argument is used.\n\nThe SeleniumLibrary `options` argument accepts Selenium options in two different formats: as a string and as Python object which is an instance of the Selenium options class.\n\nThe string format allows defining Selenium options methods or attributes and their arguments in Robot Framework test data. The method and attributes names are case and space sensitive and must match to the Selenium options methods and attributes names. When defining a method, it must be defined in a similar way as in python: method name, opening parenthesis, zero to many arguments and closing parenthesis. If there is a need to define multiple arguments for a single method, arguments must be separated with comma, just like in Python. Example: add\\_argument(\"--headless\") or add\\_experimental\\_option(\"key\", \"value\"). Attributes are defined in a similar way as in Python: attribute name, equal sign, and attribute value. Example, headless=True. Multiple methods and attributes must be separated by a semicolon. Example: add\\_argument(\"--headless\");add\\_argument(\"--start-maximized\").\n\nArguments allow defining Python data types and arguments are evaluated by using Python [ast.literal\\_eval](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#ast.literal_eval). Strings must be quoted with single or double quotes, example \"value\" or 'value'. It is also possible to define other Python builtin data types, example True or None, by not using quotes around the arguments.\n\nThe string format is space friendly. Usually, spaces do not alter the defining methods or attributes. There are two exceptions. In some Robot Framework test data formats, two or more spaces are considered as cell separator and instead of defining a single argument, two or more arguments may be defined. Spaces in string arguments are not removed and are left as is. Example add\\_argument ( \"--headless\" ) is same as add\\_argument(\"--headless\"). But add\\_argument(\" --headless \") is not same same as add\\_argument ( \"--headless\" ), because spaces inside of quotes are not removed. Please note that if options string contains backslash, example a Windows OS path, the backslash needs escaping both in Robot Framework data and in Python side. This means single backslash must be writen using four backslash characters. Example, Windows path: \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\profile\" must be written as \"C:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\path\\\\\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\profile\". Another way to write backslash is use Python [raw strings](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#string-and-bytes-literals) and example write: r\"C:\\\\\\\\path\\\\\\\\to\\\\\\\\profile\".\n\nAs last format, `options` argument also supports receiving the Selenium options as Python class instance. In this case, the instance is used as-is and the SeleniumLibrary will not convert the instance to other formats. For example, if the following code return value is saved to ${options} variable in the Robot Framework data:\n\noptions = webdriver.ChromeOptions()\noptions.add\\_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')\nreturn options\n\nThen the ${options} variable can be used as an argument to `options`.\n\nExample the `options` argument can be used to launch Chomium-based applications which utilize the [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/wiki/UsingChromeDriver) . To lauch Chomium-based application, use `options` to define binary\\_location attribute and use add\\_argument method to define remote-debugging-port port for the application. Once the browser is opened, the test can interact with the embedded web-content of the system under test.\n\nOptional `service_log_path` argument defines the name of the file where to write the browser driver logs. If the `service_log_path` argument contain a marker `{index}`, it will be automatically replaced with unique running index preventing files to be overwritten. Indices start's from 1, and how they are represented can be customized using Python's [format string syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax).\n\nOptional `executable_path` argument defines the path to the driver executable, example to a chromedriver or a geckodriver. If not defined it is assumed the executable is in the [$PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)).\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  \nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Firefox  alias=Firefox\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Edge  remote_url=http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub\nOpen Browser  about:blank    \nOpen Browser  browser=Chrome    \n```\n\nAlias examples:\n\n```\n${1_index} =  Open Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  alias=Chrome  # Opens new browser because alias is new.\n${2_index} =  Open Browser  http://example.com  Firefox    # Opens new browser because alias is not defined.\n${3_index} =  Open Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  alias=Chrome  # Switches to the browser with Chrome alias.\n${4_index} =  Open Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  alias=${1_index}  # Switches to the browser with Chrome alias.\nShould Be Equal  ${1_index}  ${3_index}      \nShould Be Equal  ${1_index}  ${4_index}      \nShould Be Equal  ${2_index}  ${2}      \n```\n\nExample when using [Chrome options](https://seleniumhq.github.io/selenium/docs/api/py/webdriver_chrome/selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.html#selenium.webdriver.chrome.options.Options) method:\n\n```\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  options=add_argument(\"--disable-popup-blocking\"); add_argument(\"--ignore-certificate-errors\")  # Sting format.\n${options} =  Get Options      # Selenium options instance.\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Chrome  options=${options}  \nOpen Browser  None  Chrome  options=binary_location=\"/path/to/binary\";add_argument(\"remote-debugging-port=port\")  # Start Chomium-based application.\nOpen Browser  None  Chrome  options=binary_location=r\"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\binary\"  # Windows OS path escaping.\n```\n\nExample for FirefoxProfile\n\n```\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Firefox  ff_profile_dir=/path/to/profile  # Using profile from disk.\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Firefox  ff_profile_dir=${FirefoxProfile_instance}  # Using instance of FirefoxProfile.\nOpen Browser  http://example.com  Firefox  ff_profile_dir=set_preference(\"key\", \"value\");set_preference(\"other\", \"setting\")  # Defining profile using FirefoxProfile mehtods.\n```\n\nIf the provided configuration options are not enough, it is possible to use [Create Webdriver](#Create%20Webdriver) to customize browser initialization even more.\n\nApplying `desired_capabilities` argument also for local browser is new in SeleniumLibrary 3.1.\n\nUsing `alias` to decide, is the new browser opened is new in SeleniumLibrary 4.0.
