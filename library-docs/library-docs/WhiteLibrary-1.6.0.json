If no prefix is given, the window is searched by title by default.\nid  Search by AutomationID.\nclass_name  Search by class name.\n```\n\nExamples:\n\n```\nAttach Window  Main Window  # attach window with title\nAttach Window  id:mainWindow  # attach window with Automation ID\nAttach Window  class_name:NavigationWindow  # attach window with ClassName\n```\n\n#### Window objects\n\nA window can also be attached by directly passing the window object as the `locator` parameter value. This may be useful if the correct window cannot be found by using the window locator syntax.\n\nExample:\n\n```\n@{windows}  Get Application Windows  \nAttach Window  ${windows[1]}  # attach window at index 1 in window list\n```\n\nWhen using a window object as the `locator` parameter value, the window is attached even if it does not belong to the currently attached application.
